## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Multi-Modal Biometric Verification

* **Face Recognition** using `dlib` and `face_recognition`
* **Voice Identification** using `Librosa` and `Resemblyzer`
* Dual verification significantly reduces spoofing and proxy attendance

### 🔐 Secure Authentication

* Password hashing with `bcrypt`
* Role-based access control:

  * 👩‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard
  * 🎓 Student Dashboard

### 📊 Smart Dashboards

* Attendance insights and tracking
* Subject-wise attendance management
* Real-time updates

### 📷 QR-Based Robust Attendance

* QR-driven session validation for added robustness
* Prevents unauthorized attendance marking

### ☁️ Cloud-Backed Data Storage

* Integrated with **Supabase** for scalable and secure data handling
